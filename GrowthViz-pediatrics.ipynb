    "## Background - growthcleanr\n",
    "\n",
    "[growthcleanr](https://github.com/carriedaymont/growthcleanr) is an automated method for identifying implausible values in anthropometric data from EHRs. It is available as open source software. It was originally designed with a focus on pediatric growth data, as stated in [Automated identification of implausible values in growth data from pediatric electronic health records](https://academic.oup.com/jamia/article/24/6/1080/3767271):\n",
    "\n",
    "> In pediatrics, evaluation of growth is fundamental, and many pediatric research studies include some aspect of growth as an outcome or other variable. The clinical growth measurements obtained in day-to-day care are susceptible to error beyond the imprecision inherent in any anthropometric measurement. Some errors result from minor problems with measurement technique. While these errors can be important in certain analyses, they are often small and generally impossible to detect after measurements are recorded. Larger measurement technique errors can result in values that are biologically implausible and can cause problems for many analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook supports review of `growthcleanr` results when working with data from **pediatric** subjects. The `growthcleanr` package has been expanded to identify implausible height and weight observations among adult subjects, from 18 up to age 65. If you are primarily working with adult subjects, please use the `GrowthViz-adults.ipynb` notebook instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GrowthViz Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this tool is to allow users to conduct post-processing and data visualization of growthcleanr output. GrowthViz is to be used **after** a data set has been run through growthcleanr.\n",
    "\n",
    "GrowthViz is a [Juypter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). It provides an environment that includes graphical user interfaces as well as interactive software development to explore data. To achieve this, GrowthViz references different software languages and packages:\n",
    " - [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) is used to import, transform, visualize and analyze the output of growthcleanr. Some of the code for the tool is directly included in this notebook. Other functions have been placed in external files to minimize the amount of code that users see in order to let them focus on the actual data.\n",
    " - Data analysis is performed using [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). The output of growthcleanr will be loaded into a [pandas DataFrame](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html). GrowthViz provides functions for transforming DataFrames to support calculation of some values, such as BMI, as well as supporting visualizations. It is expected that users will create views into or copies of the DataFrames built initially by this tool. Adding columns to the DataFrames created by this tool is unlikely to cause problems. Removing columns is likely to break some of the tool's functionality.\n",
    " - Visualization in the tool is provided by [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/). Users may generate their own charts with these utilities.\n",
    "\n",

The following code cell loads the libraries necessary for the tool to work. If you would like to incorporate other Python libraries to assist in data exploration, they can be added here. Removing libraries from this cell will very likely break the tool."
